    <ol>
        <li><font color="blue"><i>Patience</font></i>: Being patient means that I can deal with delays. This is an important strength to have in 
            life because there are many instances in which interruptions<br> may occur in the work progress. I am capable of waiting and 
            handling setbacks. <center><img src="Assets/patience.png" alt="Image stating that Patience is a virtue" width="300">
            </center></li><br>
        <li><font color="blue"><i>Organizational skills</i></font>: I am able to stay focused on different tasks, and use my time, energy, 
            strength and mental capacity effectively and efficiently in order<br> to achieve the desired outcome. which is evident in the 
            fact that I go to University full-time while also occassionally working and being the SCIT<br> first year representative.
            <center><img src="Assets/2021_planner.png" alt="Picture of a 2021 planner." width="300"></center></li><br>
        <li><font color="blue"><i>Communication Skills</i></font>: Good communication first starts with listening. Not only am I an 
            exemplary listener but I am also able to effectively relay information<br> as well as explain information to others. I am always 
            able to successfully articulate my thoughts in a way that others will understand.

    <ol>
        <li><font color="gold"><i>Patience</i></font>: This is something that I had struggled with for awhile. For most of my life I was 
            very impatient and would stress at the mention of any setbacks.<br> I wanted to do everything immediately and wait for nothing. 
            I knew this was a bad trait so overtime I taught myself how to calm myself and occupy<br> myself with other activities when 
            faced with setbacks. Setbacks are inevitable in life so it's just up to me on how I respond when faced with them.</li><br>
        <li><font color="gold"><i>Organizational skills</i></font>: This is a trait I've had from an early age. 
            I've always been strong at organizing my schedule. When I was younger and had less to do<br> therefore I could easily keep all my 
            tasks in mind however, now that I'm older and my workload and personal responsibilities have increased, I write down<br> 
            and plan out each taks that I have to carry out. And for the past 3 years I've invested in planners to help me with this.
            </li><br>
        <li><font color="gold"><i>Communication Skills</i></font>: This is a skill I've had to develop overtime due to me being very shy 
            when I was younger. The listening aspect of it was relatively<br> easy for me sincce I was always quiet and therefore 
            readily listened to others as I preffered them talking and not me. For the past 5+ years I've slowly but surely<br> broken out of 
            my shell and gained the ability to articulate myself well.</li>
